# üí´ About Me:

Hi! My name is Jacob Igel and I am a recent graduate of Miami University's Class of 2023. I majored in Information Systems and Business Analytics with a Minor in Computer Science! 

With my education, I have learned many skills in languages like R, Python, Java, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I love learning about new and innovative techniques and cannot wait to connect with you to learn more!

I have also served as an executive member of my Social Fraternity Phi Mu Alpha (Membership Educator), my Co-Ed Service Sorority Tau Beta Sigma (Vice President), and the Miami University Marching Band Drumline (Section Leader). 

Currently open to work!
